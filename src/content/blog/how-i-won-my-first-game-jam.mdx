I **won**. With a **_bad_ game**.

Check out the **[source code](https://github.com/Irtaza2009/Glitch-Out)** for the game, or try it out **[here](https://irtaza.xyz/My-Games/Glitch-Out/WebGL/)**. (**Warning**: It's bad...)

</summary>

I had **got into** programming in 2021, and **loved** it since, and made some **very** basic projects. Most of these projects focused on **gamedev**, but none of them were _proper_, and most were not even fully finished. I had participated in some **game jams** before, but had only **got to submitting** to one or two, and **not** winning any.

_But that was about to **change**!_  
</details>


## The new beginning
It's the July of 2024, and I discovered [Arcade](https://hackclub.com/arcade/) through the **GitHub Education Newsletter**, and decided to participate in it.

</div>

Then at the start of August, the **Arcade Jam** was announced.

And I **decided** to take part.

During the **next** 24 hours, everyone **submitted** an idea for the theme, and then voting **opened** up to decide the theme.

## The theme
Finally, after a wait of **3 days**, the theme was **announced**.

![](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/3ca784f303ddc4f2fbfba95c564873a3e1298aaf_chrome_pvkfoiacgq.png)

### **Loopholes**!

I was super **excited** because this was a **great** theme, and immediately started **brainstorming**.

And after a lot of notes and sketches, **this is what I came up with**:

> You are trapped in a **simulation** with a world full of **_bugs_** and **_glitches_**. To escape, you must **exploit** these flaws to reach a hidden **underground** area. Your journey involves **navigating** through challenges, **discovering** secrets, and **manipulating** the environment to your **advantage**.

Or **basically**:

You are a **box**, trapped in a maze full of **obstacles**, but the obstacles are really easy to cross, because they are **filled** with bugs (think walls with no colliders... etc).

And then I ~~immediately start working on it~~ **_procrastinated_**. _For the next **full** week_.

## Awakening
With only a **week** left till the end of the jam, I finally convinced myself to start working on my game.

First I made a **cube**. And then I made and attached a **PlayerController** script to it. Aaand I had my player.

Then I watched some tutorials (_[Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYbK_tjZ2OrIZFBvU6CCMiA)_), and learned **ProBuilder**.

After mastering **ProBuilder** (_watching one tutorial_), I got to work with the level designing. That was pretty easy. I just made whatever came to my mind.

Using **ProBuilder**, and skipping complex 3D modeling and embracing simple geometric shapes, I was able to build multiple levels in a couple of days.

Oh and of course I also added a **pool**. A pool that you can **_walk_** on, because why not (definitely **not** because I didn't how to make proper water.).

![](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/09a4e4b7fbbcb8d623b2907cc82d19994494560e_chrome_oh5h0m8ri1.jpg)

Then I **polished** all of the levels I had designed, and joined them all! This is where I had to get creative. So I added some **hallways**, **fake walls**, **some interactive boxes**, **more fake walls**, and there, I had my **simulation world**!

Of course, I am not going to give away **_all the secrets_** of the **game**, because that would _spoil_ it...

Now came the time to code the **logic**. I already had my player controller. So I scrapped together some scripts for **interactions**, **collision logic** etc.

And then I also added a **menu screen** with a bit of text (with _really_ bad styling) and a **play button**, and a **game over screen**.

The **_key_ mechanic** of the game was finding the **weakness** in the levels boundary. Be it in the form of **_hidden_ interactable blocks**, **fake walls**, **walkable pools**.

And I think that was it.

Yeah, I did not add any **sfx** or **music**. I hadn't added _any_ **audio** to any of my projects before. I realised after this game jam from the feedback I received that I should add **audio/sfx/music** to stuff.

## Submitting
Ok so all of the stuff I did in the last section happened in the span of the full week. So like now I had to submit my game.

I exported a WebGL build from Unity, troubleshot why it didn't work on my github pages site, found the solution (which was enable **Decompression Fallback** in the **build settings**), and got the **game** working on the **web**! **_Yayy_**!

And I improved the game's **GitHub** repository, made the **README** just a _teeny tiny bit_ **better** (so now it contained the **game's title, description, controls, and URL**, compared to just the **game's title** before).

Oh and I also thought up of a **cool** name for the game!

### **Glitch Out**!

And finally I filled out the **submission form**!

## Voting
Voting opened up. Every game was going to be **peer-voted**! In the format of **random 1v1 matchups**. And all of the other games were pretty good. As I got through the other games, I kept on finding ways in which I could have **improved** and **polished** my game more. Like **audio**. 

And then came the **3 days** wait before the **results** were going to be **announced**.

## Results
_And then **this** happened!!!_

![](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/74ffd220701a432b259c172d83bb88454b3ec516_chrome_zmagqnxvgu.png)

I **couldn't** believe it at first... Like my game was ok **theme-wise**, but other than that, it was _terrible_.

But I had got **second place**!! And thus was among the **top 5 winners**! And I was also going to get a **prize** (which since the **jam** was part of a **bigger** event, [Arcade](https://hackclub.com/arcade/), was a **token multiplier**, but for me, let's say it was the equivalent of a [Keychron K6 Pro](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k6-pro-qmk-via-wireless-custom-mechanical-keyboard?srsltid=AfmBOoqEsnkUK6zIwAg2vZ9SM94yL2Tenn9VOsPkcPM3KqKbe_srd4zg)), but of course I **hadn't** participated for the **prize**, I had participated for the **experience**.

But winning a **prize** was a great bonus!

## Epilogue
Overall, this **game jam** was a great experience for me! And my **first** win in a game jam, which felt like an **epic** moment! I learnt a lot of things (like the **importance** of audio...), and had a lot of **fun**! And for the **first** time, I beat **procrastination**, and actually had **fun making the game**. I was **_motivated_** for it.

Oh and btw, the game I submitted for the jam is **_[open-source](https://github.com/Irtaza2009/Glitch-Out)_**, and you can also try it out **[here](https://irtaza.xyz/My-Games/Glitch-Out/WebGL/)**. (**Warning**: It's bad...)
